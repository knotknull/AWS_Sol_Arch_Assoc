Notes for acloud.guru AWS Solution Architect Associate training







Availability Zone == Data Center, can have multiple DCs in an AZ

Region: geographical area, each Region consists of 2 or more AZ.

Edge Location: endpoints for AWS which is used to cache content i.e. CloudFront (CDN)


Main course topics: compute, storage, databases, network, content delivery, security, IAM, compliance


## Identity and Access Management / S3

IAM: manage users and level of access to AWS Console



IAM Features: 
    - Centralized controle of AWS Account
    - Shared access to your AWS Account
    - Granular perms
    - Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn)
    - Multifactor Authentication
    - Provide temproary access for users / devices / services
    - Password rotation policy
    - Integrates with AWS services
    - Supports PCI DSS Compliance


Key IAM Aspects: 
    Users:    end users sucha as people, employees etc
    Groups:   collection of users, each user in the group will inherit the permissions of the group
    Policies: policies made up of policy documents (JSON that gives perms to what a User, Group, or Role is able to do)
    Roles :   create roles and assign to resources



## IAM LAB

> Console > Search > IAM
Upper right shows login console: 

https://iamwhatiam.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

NOTE:  I changed it to knotknull for the alias:
https://knotknull.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


Root Account:  Account that created the AWS account == "God Mode"

Policies > choose a police (i.e. Administrator Access), click on "+" for JSON: 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

- IAM is universal, does not apply to regions
- root account has full Admin Access
- new user has not access, can add console and programtic access

## S3 

Simple Storage Service 
- object storage
    - key (name) / value (data)
    - version ID
    - metadata
    - ACLs
    - toreents

- data spread across multiple devices / facilities
- size: 0 bytes to 5TB files **
- unlimited storage
- files stored in buckets (think folder)
- universal namespace: must be globally unique
- successful upload:  HTTP 200 code
NOTE: not suitable for installing an OS on 


# S3 Consistency:
    - Read after Write for PUTS of new objects
    - Eventural Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (propogates)
        - could get older version or deleted file


# S3 Versioning: 
    Can version buckets and suspend versioning:
    - versioning give a version to each new put a key
    - suspending versioning makes the version id null 
        - if there versions without a null version id they will remain
        - putting a new entry with a key that has a null will overwrite the null key version
    - MFA Delete
    - Encryption

# S3 Guarantees:
    - 99.9% Availability **
    - 99.9999999999% Durability **    (11 9's )


# S3 Storage Classes

- S3 Standard
    - 99.99 Availability / 99.9999999 durability
        - stored redundantly across multiple devices / multiple facilities 
            - sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently

- S3 IA (infreqeuently accessed)
    - less frequent access
    - requires rapid access when needed
    - lower fee than S3, charged retrieval fee


- S3 One Zone - IA (infreqeuently accessed)
    - low cost IA
    - don't require multiple AZs resiliency
NOTE: was known as RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)


- S3 Intelligent Tiering
    - optimize costs by automatically moving data to most cost effective access tier,
        - no performance impact / no operational overhead

- S3 Glacier
    - low cost storage for data archiving
        - retrieval time from minutes to hours

- S3 Deep Archive
    - lowest cost storage 
        - retrieval time 12 hours

S3 Charges: 
- storage
- requests
- management priceing (tiers)
- data transfer
- transfer acceleration
    - use CloudFront to speed up bucket transfers
- cross region replication



Buckets viewed globally but can be housed regionally

Access:   **
    - Bucket Policies: applies across the entire bucket
    - Object Policies: applies to individual files
    - IAM policies to Users and groups: applies to users / groups


# S3 pricing
    - storage
    - requests / data retrieval
    - data transfer
    - mgmt & replication

S3 and S3 Intelligent Tiering is same for frequent access, less for IA tier
cost hierarchy: 
    S3 Std > S3 IA > S3 IA > S3 One Zone IA > Glacier > Glacier Deep Archive  **


# S3 Security / Encryption

    - Bucket Policies
    - ACL (to object)

S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs make to bucket.

Encryption in Transit 
    - SSL / TLS (https)

Encryption at Rest 
 - Server Side
    - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3: Amazon manages keys
    - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS: manage keys with AWS Key Management Service
    - Server Side Encryption w/ Customer Provided Keys:  SSE-C
    - NEW: Dual-Layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS Service Keys (DSSE-KMS)

 - Client Side Encryption
    - customer encrypts and uploads

Can encrypt individual objects and at bucket level.


# S3 Versioning 
    - stores all versions of an object (soft delete)
    - once enabled, CANNOT DISABLE, only suspend  **
    - lifecycle rules
    - MFA Delete


Note: latest version is available (can be made public)
      - lower versions not made available/public unless specifically made so
      DELETING the DELETE MARKER makes most recent version available  **

# S3 Lifecycle Rules
    - Automates moving objects between storage tiers 
        - can be used w/ versioning 
        - current and prior versions
buckets > bucket > management > lifecycle configuration > create rule 

# S3 Object Lock & Glacier Vault Lock
    Object Lock: write once, ream many (WORM)
        - prevent object from being deleted / modified for fixed amount of time or indefinitely 

        - Governance Mode: users can't overwrite or delete and object version or alter lock settings  **
                - special perms needed

        - Compliance Mode: protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by ANY USER (including root user)  **
            - ensures object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period (i.e. 7 Years)

        retention period: protects object version for fixed amount of time  
            - timestamp of expiration kep in version metadata

        - Legal Hold: prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted
                - does not have a retention period.  In place until removed
                - can be applied / removed with s3:PutObjectLegalHold perm

    Glacier Vault Lock: deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier Vaults 
            with Vault Lock Policy. 
                - specify controls in a Vault Lock Policy
                    - policy locked from future edits
- Object Lock == WORM
- Object Lock applied to objects or bucket
- governance mode and compliance mode
- Glacier Vault Lock = compliance controls for Glacier Vaults
    - Vault Lock policy locked for edits



# S3 Performance
    S3 Prefix:   between bucket name and object name 
        i.e.  /bucketname/folder1/subfolder2/xyz.txt  >> Prefix = /folder1/subfolder2


S3 latency:  1st byte within 100 - 200 ms

Throughput Requests can achieve: 
    - 3500 PUT / COPY / POST / DELETE   per PREFIX  **
    - 5500 GET/HEAD requests per second per PREFIX  **


NOTE: can get better performance by spreading reads across different prefixes i.e.:
    - 2 prefixes (/folder1/subfolder2) 11,000 requests / sec
    - 4 prefixes (/folder1/subfolder2/dir1/dir2 ) 22,000 requests / sec

MORE PREFIXES == BETTER PERFORMANCE !!  **

SSE-KMS Quotas: 

 - KMS Request rates: 
    - SSE-KMS has KMS limits 
        - upload   file:  GenerateDataKey in KMS API
        - download file:  Decrypt in KMS API

KMS Quota is region specific **
    - 5500 or 10k or 30k requests per second  **

NOTE: CANNOT REQUEST QUOTA INCREASE FOR KMS 


Uploads

    Multi-part uploads:
        - recommended for files over 100 MB  **
        - required for files over  5 GB   

Downloads:
    S3 Byte-Range fetches: 
        - parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges
        - can speed up downloads
        - download partial file

# S3 Select & Glacier Select
    S3 Select:  retrieve subtset of data from object using simple SQL expressions
        - retrieve only data you need
            - performance increase 
                - up to 400% faster  ** 
                - up to 80% cheaper

    Glacier Select:  Similar to S3 Select but run against Glacier

# AWS Organizations and Consolidated billing

AWS Organizations: account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts 
    into an organization to centally manage. 
    Accounts under organization unit under ROOT  with policies at the OU and account
OU = Organizational Unit

{Organization}
---------------
[Policy]    [ROOT]          
      |   /        \   +---[Policy]              [Policy]
     [OU]           \  |                            /
    /    \           [OU]----------------------+   /       
[Account]  \           |                       |  /
             [OU]    [Account]                [OU]---------+
           /      \                          / |           |
     [Account]    [Account]         [Account] [Account] [Account]      

Consolidated Billing: 
    - Paying account (cannot access sub resources) linked to AWS accounts


                        +------[Test/Dev]
                        |
    [Paying Account] ---+------[Production]
                        |
                        +------[Back Office]

Consolidates usage for volume discounts

- Root Account should always have MFA
- Paying account should be for billing only 
    - do no deploy resources to paying account
- Service Control Policies on OU or individual account  **
    - enable / disable AWS Services


# Share S3 Buckets Across Accounts
    - 3 ways to share S3 Buckets across acounts  **
        1. Bucket Policies and IAM
            - across the entire bucket
            - programatic access only
        2. Bucket ACLs and IAM 
            - individual objects
            - programatic access only
        3. Cross-account IAM Roles
            - programatic access 
            - console access 

IAM > Roles > Create Role
    - Another AWS Account
    - Attach permission policies to role
        i.e. AmazonS3FullAccess
    - Role Name > Create Role

NOTE:  Give this link to users who can switch roles in the console   **
    user logs in an clicks "Switch Role" under id or use link


# Bucket replication
S3 > buckets > bucket > Replication Rule > Create Replication Rule

NOTE: Source and replicated buckets need to be versioned !! **
    - Detele markers are not replicated 
    - Permissions on source bucket will replicate across regions

# S3 Transfer Acceleration
    - utilizes CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate uploads
        - use distinct URL to upload to edge location which is then transfered to S3


# DataSync
    - move large amounts of data to AWS
    - AWS DataSync Agent  (on prem)
    - locally connects to NAS or SMB filesystem
        - copy to AWS 
        - write from AWS 
    - Connects to AWS Services: 
        - S3
        - EFS
        - FSx for Windows File Server
    - Hourly, daily or weekly
NOTE: can replicate EFS to EFS 


# CloudFront
 - Content Delivery Network
    - pushes contact to local Points of Presence
    - Edge Location:  where content is cached
        - Can Read and Write to Edge Locations
    - Origin       :  Origin of all files distributed via ECN
        - bucket
        - ec2 instance 
        - ELB
        - Route 53
    - Distributon  :  Name of the CDN
        - collection of Edge Locations

    - Can deliver:
        - Static
        - Dynamic
        - Streaming
        - Interactive content

    - Objects cached for the TTL (Time To Live) 

    Web Distribution:  Used for websites
    RTMP :  Media Streaming

NOTE: Can clear cached objects, will be charged


Can restrict access via signed URLs or signed cookies

Domain Name created for Cached Content
i.e. https://d16s698dkl8k6u.cloudfront.net

https://d16s698dkl8k6u.cloudfront.net/README.txt

NOTE:  can invalidate the Distribution:  CloudFront > Distributions > Invalidations


# CloudFront Signed URLs and Cookies

    - Signed URLs  :  1 file   = 1 URL
    - Signed Cookie:  1 cookie = multiple files


Attach policy to 
    - URL Expiration
    - IP Ranges
    - Trusted Signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLS)


Origin Access Identity (OAI):  
    - users access CloudFront which then access S3 bucket via OAI 


CloudFront SDK generates Signed URL

    - key pari of Signed URL is account wide (managed by ROOT)

S3 Signed URL 
    - request as IAM user who creates presigned URL 
    - limited lifetime

Origin is EC2 use CloudFront
Origin is S3  use S3 Signed URL

security group is a "virtual firewall"

Termination Protection turned off by default 

Root EBS volume will be default deleted when instance terminated
    - Root valume can be encrypted


# Security Groups

- firewall for a resource 
    - change to a security group rule takes place immediately
    NOTE: security groups are STATEFULL 
            - creating an inbound rule will allow for the corresponding outbound rule 
                i.e. HTTP / 80 IN will automatically allow HTTP / 80 OUT 

NOTE:  You can't block a particular port or IP address in a security group, can only do that with NACLs
       Security groups block everything by DEFAULT.

       NACLs are STATELESS, need to create both inbound and outbound rule

- can attach more than one security group to an EC2 instance

- All Inbound  traffic BLOCKED by default
- All Outbound traffic ALLOWED by default
- Security Groups are STATEFUL 
    - those allowed IN are also allowed OUT
- Cannot block specific ports or IP addresses using Security Groups
    - use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

- Can have any number of EC2 instances in a security group
- Can have multiple security groups attached to an EC2 instances 
- Can only specify "ALLOW" rules in a Security Group 
    - default of a SECURITY GROUP is to "DENY" everything


# EBS

- Elastic Block Store 
    - persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances
        - virtual hard disk in cloud
    - automatically replicated within its Availability Zone

5 Types of EBS Storage:
    - General Purpose (SSD)
    - Provisioned IOPS (SSD)
    - Throughput Optimised Hard Disk Drive  (Physical Magnetic drive)
    - Cold Hard Disk Drive
    - Magnetic

# EBS Volumes and Snapshots

- EBS and EC2 instances are in the same AZ

- root EBS volumes destroyed when instance is destroyed
    - attached non-root volumes persist when instance terminated

- can change size of drive on the fly (have to extend file system to get the additional storage)

- can change the volume type (ex. gp3 to iop) on the fly

Exam question:  how to move volume and ec2 instance to another AZ
    > volumes > select volume > create snapshot

    > created snapshot > create image
        NOTE: set Virtualization Type as "Hardware-assisted virtualization"
             Allows for greater selection of EC2 instance types

Once image is created:
    > AMIs > select created image >  Launch > choose new AZ to spin up into

NOTE: 
    AMI > copy AMI to a different region

Snapshots exist on S3
Snapshots are point in time copy of volumes
Snapshots are incremental 
    - only blocks that have changes since last snapshot are moved to S3

Can create AMIs from snapshots


# AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store)

AMI factors: 
    - Region
    - OS
    - Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
    - Launch Perms
    - Storage for Root Device (Root Dev Vol)

    - Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)
        - root device is instance store volume created from template stored in S3
        NOTE: instance store restricts type of instance types
                can only reboot or terminate in instance store ec2 instance 
                CANNOT STOP instance store e2c instance 
                If you stop instance store you will lose all data on that instance (EPHEMERAL storage)

    - EBS Backed Volumes
        - root device created from an EBS snapshot
        - EBS instance can be stopped without losing data
    
    Can reboot both Instance Store and EBS Backed Volumes wihout losing data

    Can keep EBS volume after termination, Instance Store loses all data

ENI vs ENA vs EFA 

ENI - Elastic Network Interface
     virtual network card 

EN  - Enhanced Networking  / Enhanced Networking Adapter
    Single root I/O virtualization  (SR-IOV)
    high performance netwoking on supported instance types 
    NOTE:  ENA is a subset of Enhanced Netowrking

EFA - Elastic Fabric  Adapter
    network device than can attached to EC2 instance to accelerate 
    High Performance Computing (HPC) and Machine Learning apps


ENI: virtual network card 
    - primary private IPv4 address from IPv4 address range
    - One or more secondare private IPv4 address from IPv4 address range
    - One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address 
    - One public IPv4 address
    - One or more IPv6 addresses
    - One or more security groups
    - One MAC address
    - source / destination check flag
    - description

    - create a management network (separate traffice)
    - use network and security applianced in VPC
    - dual-homed instances with workloads / roles on distinct subnets
    - low budget, high availability solution


EN: Enahcned Networking 
    - single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV)
        SR-IOV device virtualization provides hight I/O and lower CPU utilization 
         compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces

    - higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, 
      lower inter-instance latencies.  
      NOTE: No additional changed for using enhanced networking
      user for good networking performance

    Depending on Instance type, enhanced networking enabled by: 

    Enhanced Network Adapter (ENA)  up to 100Gbps
    or
    Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface, supports up to 10 Gbps
     (older instances)


EFA: Elastic Frabric Adapter
    network device attach to EC2 instance to accelerate HPC and ML
    provides lower and more consistent latency and higher thruput than TCP transport
    EFA can us OS-bypass.  
        Allows apps to bypass OS kernel and communicate directly with EFA device
            (only Linux)


Encrypted Root Device Volumes & Snapshots

How to create an encrypted image from unencrypted volume

bring up ec2 instance > volumes > create snapshot:  my_unencrypted_snap 

snapshots > copy my_unencrypted_snap > 
    - check Encrypt this snapshot 
    - default key
        > my_encrypted_snap


snapshots > select  my_encrypted_snap  > create image > my_encrypted_image

AMI > select my_encrypted_image > Launch Instance

NOTE:  
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
- Can share snapshots but only if they are unencrypted
- snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts / made public
- Can NOW encrypt root device volumes upon creation of EC2 instance **


# Spot Instaces & Spot Fleets

Spot instance: 
 - take advantage of unused ec2 capacity with up to 90% discount of on-demand
     - can be used for stateless, fault-tolerage, flexible apps
       - containerized workloads
       - CI/CD, web servers, etc
       - image / rendering
       - HPC
       - analytics
    NOT GOOD FOR: 
       - persistent workloads
       - critical jobs
       - databases

 - decide on maximum spot price
    - instance provisioned as long as spot price is below your maximum spot price

 - hourly spot price varies hourly 

 - if spot price goes above your maximum, have 2 minutes to choose whether 
    to stop or terminate your instance

 - Spot block, stop spot instances from being terminated even if the spot price is 
    over your max spot price.   Spot Blocks only for 1 to 6 hours **



Spot Instance Termination 


                                                     +------below spot price ----> request failed
                                                     |
create requet -> [ Spot Request ]   -----------------+        +--------- stop ------+  
                   - max price                       |        v       (persistent)  |
                                                     |      start                   |

                        - one time                   +------Launch instance --------+  
                        - persistent                                                |
                   - valid from / to                                            Interrupt
                                                                                (one-time)

NOTE:  if the request is one-time
             then once the price crosses it is terminated
       if the request is persistent
            then once the price crosses it is stopped
            if price comes back down the instance is started again
               until it is interrupted


Spot Fleet
    - collection of spot instances 
        and on-demand instance

    - spot fleet attempts to launch the number of spot instances and 
       on demand instances to satisfy the spot fleet target capacity 
                spot instances + on demand instances == spot fleet target capacity

    - tries to match target capacity with price restraint

    - setup different launc pools 
        - define: instance type, OS, AZ
        - Can have multiple pools
            - fleet will determine best way to implement strategy
        - spot fleets will stop launching instances once you reach price threshold 
            capacity desire state

Spot Fleet Strategies:
    - capacityOptimized
        spot instances come from pool with optimal capcity         
        for the number of instances launching

    - lowestPrice
        spot instances come from pool with lowest price

    - diversified
        spot instances are distributed across all pools

    - InstancePoosToUseCount
        spot instances are distributed across the number of 
        spot instance pools specified.  Only valid with lowestPrice
            like diversified + lowestPrice


# EC2 Hibernate
 - OS told to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk)
 - saves contents from RAM to EBS root volume
 - root volume and attached EBS volumes are persisted

starting out of hibernation:
    - root volume restored to previous state
    - RAM contents are reloaded
    - processes previously running are resumed
    - previously attached data volumes are reattached 
       instance retains its instance ID
    - boots instance faster
        - don't have to restart OS or Apps

good for:
    - long running processes
    - services that take a long time to initialize


NOTE:   Instance RAM must be less than 150 GB in size.    **
        Instance Families:  C3, C4, C5, M3, M4, M5, R3, R4, R5
        Available for: Windows, Amazon Linux 2 AMI, Ubuntu
        CANNOT BE HIBERNATED FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS

# EFS

Elastic File System 
 - file system for EC2 instances
 - capacity is elastic, do not have to pre-provision
 - for linux based 
 - like EBS 
    - EBS can only be mounted by one machine
    - EFS volume can be mounted by several machines

- on prem can access EFS via DirectConnect
- 2 performance modes:
    - general purpose 
    - max i/o

- EFA IA (Infreq. Access)
    - cheaper instance

- data redundant across multiple AZs


NOTE: ensure NFS protocol has been added to inbound rule  of the security group for the instance mounting the EFS



Create EFS cluster 

to mount on EC2 

sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-0655fd1617d986dbd:/ efs


- EFS supports NFS v4 
- only pay for storage used
- scale up to petabytes
- can support 1000s of concurrent NFS connections
- Data store across multiple AZs within a region
- Consistency:  Read after Write

SMB == FSx for Windows


# EC2 Placement Groups 

 - A way to place EC2 instances 
 3 types of Placement Groups: 
    - Clustered Placement Group
    - Spread Placement Group
    - Partitioned 


Clustered Placement Group
 - grouping of instances within a single AZ
 - apps that need low network latency
 - high network throughput or both
NOTE: only certain instances can be launched in 
   to a Clustered Placement Group

Spread Placement Group (Opposite of Clustered)
 - group of instances that are each placed on distinct 
   underlying hardware
        - separate rack
        - separate network
        - separte power
  i.e. if a rack fails, only that instance fails      
 - apps that have a small number of critical instances 
    that should be kept separate from each other
 - Individual Critical Instances
 - can be in different AZs in one region


Partitioned Placement Groups (Similar to Spread )
 - each group divided into logical segments (partitions)
 - each partition within a placement group  has its own set of racks
 - each rack has own network and power source
 - no 2 partitions within placement group share same racks

multiple instances per partition
     i.e. HDFS, HBash, Cassandra


Name of placement group must be unique within AWS Account
Only certain types of instances can be launched in placement group 
    - Compute Optimized 
    - GPU, Memory Optimized   (COGMOS)
    - Storage Optimizes

AWS recommends homogenous instances within clustered placement groups

Can't merge placement groups 

Can move an instance into a placement group 
    - must be in stopped state 
    - can move or remove and instance via CLI or SDK (not console, is this still correct ?)

      or give HTTP 403 status code

WAF allows 3 Types of Behaviors:
    - allow all requests except ones specified
    - block all requests except ones specified
    - count the requests that mtch the properties specified

Protects against web attacks using conditions specified
Define conditions by using characteristics of web requests:
    - IP addresses that requests originiate from
    - Country that requests originiate from
    - Valaues in request headers
    - Strings that appear in requests, 
        - specific strings
        - strings that match regex patterns

            - low latency / high thruput
            - SAME AZ
            - homogenous instances 

    - Spread        (spread apart, guaranteed not on same rack) 
            - critical instances
            - can span AZs 
            
    - Partitioned   (hybird: instances close together on partitions, partiions spread apart)
            - Multiple EC2 instances: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra
            - can span AZs 

NOTE:   can't merge placement groups
        YOU CAN move existing instance into placement group  


LAB: Using Tags and Resource Groups

Tag Editor:
    - Tag multiple different types of resources using the same tags  i.e. Env=QA or Acct=112233

AWS Config:
    - can utilize rules to determine if resources are in compliance with configuration rules

LAB: EC2 Roles and Instance Profiles

IAM Role:  "what you can do"

Instance Profile:
    - can associate a role with an EC2 instance, this is what an Instance Profile is for
    - entity or container (?) connect an IAM Role to an EC2 instance
    - IAM Role  is       : "what can I do i"
    - Instance Profile is: "who am i"

- Provide Temporary Credentials that are rotated automatically

NOTE: when you create a ROLE and ATTACH to an EC2 Instance via Management Consol, 
   the creation and use of Instance Profile is handled behind the scenes 

Trust Policy: allows EC2 service to assume role  

1. Create policy trust_policy_ec2.json: 
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

2. Create Role 

aws iam create-role --role-name DEV_ROLE --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy_ec2.json

OUTPUT:  
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "DEV_ROLE",
        "RoleId": "AROAT537H4KBEDHTOPKOH",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::270312923778:role/DEV_ROLE",
        "CreateDate": "2024-11-10T21:40:42+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

NOTE: Role created with Assume Role policy attached 


3. Grant role read access to S3 Buckets, need to create policy that allows this

Create S3 Access Policy document  dev_s3_read_access.json 

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"
      ]
    }
  ]

}

NOTE:  <bucket_name>/*   allows get / list to objects within the bucket
NOTE:  <bucket_name>     allows get / list to just the bucket

4. create the managed policy: 

aws iam create-policy --policy-name DevS3ReadAccess --policy-document file://dev_s3_read_access.json

OUTPUT: 

{
    "Policy": {
        "PolicyName": "DevS3ReadAccess",
        "PolicyId": "ANPAT537H4KBAQK4ATMNH",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::270312923778:policy/DevS3ReadAccess",
        "Path": "/",
        "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
        "AttachmentCount": 0,
        "PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount": 0,
        "IsAttachable": true,
        "CreateDate": "2024-11-10T21:53:53+00:00",
        "UpdateDate": "2024-11-10T21:53:53+00:00"
    }
}

5. Attached managed policy to Role

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name DEV_ROLE --policy-arn "<DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN>"


list attached policies of role (DEV_ROLE)
 aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name DEV_ROLE
OUTPUT: 
{
    "AttachedPolicies": [
        {
            "PolicyName": "DevS3ReadAccess",
            "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::270312923778:policy/DevS3ReadAccess"
        }
    ]
}

TEST 

- Cannot delete the snapshot of a root device of an EBS volume used by a registered AMI
- can detatch an additional EBS (non-root volume)
- Hypervisors for EC2:  XEN, Nitro
- Standard Reserviced instances cannot be moved between regions
- which ec2 feature uses SR-IOV?    Enhanced Netowrking
- Cheapest EBS options are always HDD over SDD !!!!
- Changes to IAM policies take effect almost immediatly
    - IAM Policy exists in AWS API and not on instance itself
- IP Address to retrieve instance meta-data or user-data:  http://169.254.169.254
- Spread placement groups can be deployed across Availability Zones
- IAM Roles an be attached to instances in stopped or running state or 
   replaced for instances in the running state
- You can control whether an EBS root volume is deleted when its associated instance is terminated.
   By default, the DeleteOnTermination attribute for root volumes is set to 'true.' 
- which AWS cli command shouldI use to crate a snapshot of an EBS volume: 
    aws ec2 create-snapshot 


## Databases on AWS

AWS RDBMS (RDS):
    - SQL Server
    - Oracle
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
    - Aurora
    - MariaDB

2 Key Features: 
- Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery 
- Read Replicas - Performance

Multi-AZ
 - AWS points DNS for RDS instance to an IP, 
    fail over points DNS to second IP 
 - failovers automatic with Multi-AZ


Read Replicas
 - write to primary db is replicated to Read Replica
 - No automatic fail over
 - can have 5 read replicas


DynamoDB:
 - NoSQL
 - Collection holds Documents, key - value pair
 -  Document can have different fields

Data Warehousing:
OLTP vs OLAP

Redshift (OLAP): 
- Amazon Data Warehouse:  

ElastiCache:
- web service for in-memory cache in cloud 
- improves web app performance by caching to in-memory
- 2 open source in-memory caching engines
     - memcached
     - redis


## RDS LAB

connectivity endpoint: map-sql-db.cjy7mdwejhd4.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- RDS runs on virtual machines 
    - can't login to RDS VMs 
- RDS patching OS and DB is Amazon's responsibility
- RDS is NOT SERVERLESS

bootstrap: 

#!/bin/bash
yum install amazon-linux-extras httpd -y 
amazon-linux-extras install php7.2 -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
rm -rf wordpress
rm -rf latest.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/*
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/*

NOTE: THIS DID NOT WORK !!!  PHP was not running

# RDS Backups, Multi-AZ, Read Replicas

2 types of backups: 
    - automated backups 
        - allow you to recover db to any point in time within a retention period
            - retention period between 1 and 35 days
        - takes full daily snapshot and stores transaction logs through out day.
        - On recovery, AWS will frst choos most recent daily backup and apply transaction logs
        - enabled by DEFAULT
        - stored to S3  / free storage space equal to size of DB. 
        - backups taken within a defined window
        - during backup window, storage I/O may be suspended while your data is being backed up 
            - may experience latency 

    - snapshots
        - DB Snapshots are done manually (user initiated)
        - They are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance

when you restore, the restored version of DB will be a new RDS instance with new DNS endpoint

Encryption: 
    - encryption at rest supported for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora **
    - done via KMS
    - once RDS instance is encrypted, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted
        - backups, read replicas and snapshots are also encrypted

Multi-AZ: 
    - exact copy of Prod DB in another AZ
    - All writes hitting Prod DB synchronized to other AZ
        - AWS handles syncing
    - if database maintenance, or DB or AZ Failure, RDS fails over to standby 
        - no admin intervention
        - it updates URL to backup
    - for DR only, NOT USED FOR PERFORMANCE
    - available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB **


Read Replica: 
    - main DB asyncronously replicated to multiple instances
        - can read from either replica and write to Prod DB
    - can have Read Replicas of Read Replicas (watch for latency)
    - available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora **
    - Used for PERFORMANCE NOT DR
    - Must have automatic backups turned on to deploy read replica
    - up to 5 read replicas copies of any db
    - each Read Replica will have its own DNS end point
    - can have Read Replicas that have multi-AZ 
    - can create Read Replicas of Multi-AZ source databases.
    - Read Replicas can be promoted to be their own databases (breaks replication)
    - Can have Read Replica in second region

RDS Backups, Multi-AZ, Read-Replicas LAB
    - modify database to be Multi-AZ
    - reboot w/ failover causes the backup to become primary

NOTE: Need to have backups turned on before creating Read Replicas **

Multi-AZ: 
 - can force a failover from one AZ to another by rebooting RDS instace


# DynamoDB 
    - NoSQL solution
    - single digin ms latency 
    - fully managed db
    - supports document and key-value
    - flexible data model ideal for 
        - mobile, web 
        - gaming, ad-tech
        - IoT, etc


    - Stored on SSD
    - spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers **
    - Eventually Consistent Reads (Default)
        - consistency across all copies of data usually reached within 1 second 
        - Best Read Performance
    - Strongly Consistent Reads
        - returns result that reflects all writes that received a successful respons 
          prior to the read ( less than 1 second)
        - if update is done and need to read that update in less than 1 second

# Advanced DynamoDB 
DynamnoDB Accelerator (DAX)
    - fully managed, highly available in-memory cache
    - 10x performance improvement
    - Reduces request time from milliseconds to microseconds
    - don't need to manage caching logic
    - Compatible with DynamoDB API calls

    [ Application ]  <------>  [ DAX ] <------>  [ DynamoDB ]

        - no change to application
        - DAX has write thru cache
        - High Availability, will failover to own replicat in another AZ


Transactions
    - Multiple "all or nothing" operations 
        - financial transactions
        - fulfilling orders
    - Two underlying reads / writes  **
        - prepare / commit 
    - Up to 25 items or 4 MB of data


On-Demand Capacity
 - pay-per-request pricing
 - balance cost / performance
 - no minimume capacity
 - no read/write charges when idle
    - only storage and backups
 - pay more per request than provisioned capacity
 - use for new product launces


On-Demand Backup and Restore
 - full backups at any time
 - zero impact on table performance / availability
 - consistent within seconds / retained until deleted
 - operates within same resion as the source table

Point-in-Time Recover (PITR)
 - protects against accidental writes / deletes 
 - restore to any point in the last 35 days
 - incremental backups
 - NOTE enabled by default  **
 - latest restorable: five minutes in the past


Streams: 
 - Time-ordered sequence of item-level changes in a table 
 - FIFO
 - stored for 24 hours
 - inserts, updates, deletes


stream record
  - single modification to Dynamo DB table
  - each stream record assigned squence number
  - stream record organized into groups / shards 
  - shard contains info on iterating thru records
  - combine with Lambda functions for functionality "like" stored procedures in traditional databases


                                    shard (group of stream records)

# Caching Strategies

- CloudFront
- API Gateway
- ElastiCache - Memcached and Redis
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)


# EMR Overview
Elastic Map Reduce
    - cloud big data platform
    - used with 
        - Spark, Hive, HBase, Flink, Hudi, Presto 

- EMR cluster collection of EC2 instances i.e. node: 
    - different software on each node type 
    - like Apache Hadoop

Node Types: 
    - Master Node: manages cluster
        - tracks status of tasks
        - monitors healt of cluster
        - every cluster has a master node

    - Core Node: runs tasks and stores data in HDFS
        - multinode clusters have at least one core node

    - Task Node: runs tasks, DOES NOT STORE DATA
        - task nodes are optional

NOTE: Smallest cluster you can have is 1, that is a Master Node   **
      Every node can communicate with each other



Log data is store on /mnt/var/log on Master Node   **
    - can periodically archive log files on Master Node to S3 
    - EMR does this at 5 minute intervals
        - ONLY WHEN CLUSTER IS FIRST SETUP

# Database Summary


Read Replicas:
  - can be Multi-AZ  **
    - increase performance
  - Can be in different Regions **
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Aurora, MSSQL
  - Can be promoted to master / breaks replication

Multi-AZ :
 - Used for DR ONLY / not performance
 - Force a failover by rebooting RDS instance

Encryption at res: 
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Aurora, MSSQL
  - Uses KMS 

DynamoDB 
 - Serverless
 - Stored on SSD
 - Spread across 3 geo distinct data centers
 - Eventual Consistency Reads (Default) if data can be consistent > 1 sec
 - Strongly Consistency Reads if data had to be consistent < 1 sec

Redshift 
  - only in 1 AZ
  - backups enabled by default = 1 day retention
  - Attempts to keep 3 copies of data 
    - original 
    - replica on compute nodes 
    - backup in S3
  - Async replica snapshots to S3 in another region for DR

Auroroa 
    - 2 copies of data in each AZ with min 3 AZ == 6 total copies
    - auotmated backups turned on by default
    - share snapshots with other AWS accounts
    - 3 types of replicas 
        - Aurora Replicas  ( within same region = 15) 
        - MySQL replicas   (multiple regions = 5)
        - PostgresSQL      (only 1)



RDS Multi-AZ and Read Replica labs

wordpress.c9x6gz16a86n.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
load-balancer-388667590.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

Quiz:

New RDS Instance: automated backups enabled by default
Echeck for Error node in response from RDS API

DocumentDB has MongoDB compatability

Can crate RDS SQL Server max 16 TB

DynamoDB charges in a single region 
    - Read and Write Capacity
    - Storage of Data
    NOTE: no charge to data transfer within a single region, cross region is charged at both ends
            - no charge for local secondary indexes


I/O may be briefly suspended while the backup process initializes (typically under a few seconds), 
 and you may experience a brief period of elevated latency.

MySQL default port


3 data formats Athena supports 
    - Parquet, ORC, JSON


Data transferred between Availability Zones for replication of Multi-AZ deployments is free.

# IAM Policies

Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
 - uniquely identifies any resource in AWS 
begin with:

 arn:partition:service:region:account_id:

partition: aws | aws-cn
    - aws
    - aws-cn == China  (probably include GovCloud)

service:
    i.e. s3 | ec2  | rds

Region:
    i.e. us-east-1 | eu-central-1

Account ID:
    i.e. 12 dig-it accountid 123456790012


end with: 
resource
resource_type/resource
resource_type/resource/qualifier
resource_type/resource:qualifier
resource_type:resource
resource_type:resource:qualifier


examples 

arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marc              << "::" means part of name skipped over, since IAM is global, there is no region hence "::"
arn:aws:s3:::my_awsome_bucket/image.png          << ":::" means 2 parts skipped, no region or account needed for globally unique s3 bucket name
arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/orders <<  dynamodb service, resource type (table), table name
arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*    <<  specifies all resources of a particular type



IAM Policy
 - JSON document that defines permissions
 - 2 types of policies:

    - Identity Policy: 
        - attached to IAM: user, group or role 
        - specifies WHAT and identity CAN DO
            i.e. permissions

    - Resource Policy: 
        - attached to a resource
            s3, ec2, KMS keys, etc.
        - specifies WHO has access to resource
              and   WHAT actions they can perform

- NO EFFECT until attached policy is attached to Identity or Resource

- Policy == List of statements
ex.

            ...
        },                  - each statement matches an AWS API request
        {

            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:table/MyTable"
        }
    ]

}

Breakdown: 

Sid    :  "Human Readble Id for this Statement"   think statement name / desc
Effect :  either Allow or Deny                    think: allow / deny these actions on this resource
Action :  service name : action name              * wildcards: any API request that starts with that string i.e. dynamodb:Get* 
Resouce: ARN of resource                          Resource that the Action is against


mnemonic == SEAR (Sid, Effect (ALLOW|DENY), Action, Resource)


2 kinds of policies:
    - AWS Managed
    - Customer Managed

To create a policy:
IAM > policies > create > visual | JSON
ex.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-27",
    "Statement": [          
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",                       NOTE: Allow ListBucket on test bucket 
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
            "Resource": [arn:aws:s3:::test"]
        },
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",                       NOTE: Allow Put / Get / Delete on all objects under test/
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
                ],
            "Resource": [arn:aws:s3:::test/*"]
        }
    ]
}
choose name / description of policy 


Create Role 
IAM > Role > Create Role 

Here you can select type of "trusted entity": AWS Service, AWS Account, Web Identity, SAML

ex. 

select AWS Service > EC2 > [NEXT: Permissions] 
enter name of policy created above
Name / description or FOle

Attaching Role to any EC2 instance will allow the actions laid out in the policy

Can add a managed policy, as well as custom policy to Role


Inline Policy
    - works like other policy but is not formally defined as a policy
    - scope is limited to this specific role

TIPS:

- Any perms not EXPLICITY ALLOWED are IMPLICITY DENIED
    - starts off denying EVERYTHING

- EXPLICITY DENY > everything else 
    - explicit deny overrides any explicity allow of the same action / resource

- Only attached policies have an effect

With muliple policies attached to identity or resource
    - AWS JOINS (UNION) all applicable policies together


Permission Boundaries:
 - Used to delegate admin to others
    - admin creating users vs. devs needing perms for Lambda functions 

 - for IAM entities: users and roles 

 - prevent privilege escalation
    or unnecessarily broad perms

using a MANAGED POLICY to SET MAXIMUM PERMISSIONS that an IDENTITY based POLICY  can grant to an IAM ENTITY

Entity Permission Boundary allows it to perform ONLY ACTION ALLOWED 
     by BOTH Identity based policy and Permission Boundaries

NOTE: Permission Boundary controls the maximum permissions an IAM policy can grant

Use cases:
    - Devs creating roles for Lambda functions 
    - App owners creating roles for ECS instances
    - Admins creating ad hoc users

IAM > Users > user_name > Set Permission Boundary

select managed policy i.e. AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess 

hence, if user as full Admin perms, the Permission Boundary limits that to AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess 


AWS Resource Access Manager

 - allows resource sharing between accounts
     - multiple individual accounts
     - AWS Organization

Resources that can be shared using RAM:
    App Mesh
    Aurora
    CodeBuild
    EC2
    EC2 Image Builder
    License Manager
    Resource Groups
    Rout 53
ex.
Launch EC2 instance in a shared subnet 
    - Acct 1 has a private subnet 
    - Acct 2 can launch instances into the Shared subnet

ex. RDS 

Acct1 
    - Auroa Database cluster

Goal is to share into Acct 2

Resource Access Manager > Create a resource share
Name: Aurora Cluster Share 
Resources:   Aurora DB clusters
 - select cluster


Principals:
[x] Allow external accounts
Enter Account number for Acct 2

[create resource share]


Acct 2: 
RDS > Databases > refresh
Nothing is shown


Details of share show shared principal in "Associating" state. 

NOTE: Acct 1 sends and invite to Acct 2 to share resource

Acct 2 > Resource Acces Share > Shared with me > Resource Shares 
- pendng invitation
 - click 
 - accept resource share

RDS > refresh 
Role "Shared from account ...."


AWS Single Sign On

 - SSO service helps centally manage access to AWS accounts / business apps.
    - can be third party 
        i.e. Box, GitHub Slack, SeriveNow, Office365, etc.

 - can sign into AWS accounts i (and 3rd party accts)
   using SSO portal with corporate identities

Granular Account-Level Perms

SSO integrates with Active Directory or 
  any SAML 2.0 Identity Provider
    i.e. Azure AD
 
  - can log into SSO portal with Active Directory creds
  - SSO can grant access to AWS Organizations 
        - OU=Dev, OU=Prod
  - SSO can grant access SAML 2.0 enabled applications

SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language
 - standard to log users into applications 
     based on sessions in another context 
        i.e. Microsoft Active Directory
           or businss app i.e. GSuite

NOTE:  All signon activities recorded in CloudTrail

If you see SAML in question, look for SSO in answers

    Route 53

SSO:
 - use existing corporate identities
 - Account Level perms 
 - SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language 


## Route 53

DNS is on port 53


IPv4:  32 bits ==>> 4.2 Billion
IPv6: 128 bits ==>>  340 undecillion addr

Top Level Domain:  .com , .edu, .gov

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
 - root zone database
 - db of all top level domains

domain names in whois 

Every Domain Record has 

SOA:  Start of Authority Record
 - name of the server that supplied data for the zone
 - the administrator of the zone
 - current version of the data file
 - default number of seconds for TTL on resource records

NS: Name Server Records
 - used by Top Level Domain servers to direct traffice to the 
    Content DNS server which contains the authoritative DNS records.


xyz.com >> TLD  xyz.com  172800 IN NS ns.awsdns.com    >>  NS Records (and Name Server) >> SOA record >> DNS Records


DNS Records contain several types of records: 

"A" record: fundamental type of DNS Record 
    "A" stands for Address
    translates name to IP addr 

TTL: length that a DNS record is cached,  Time To Live
        Default TTL = 48 hours, lower number faster update


CName:  Canonical Name 
    - resolve one domain to another
    ex. m.xyz.com ==>> moble.xyz.com


Alias Records:   
 - map resource record sets in hosted zone to ELB, CloudFrond or S3 buckets 
    that are configured as websites
Like an CName

map xyz.com ==>> elb1234.ebl.amazonaws.com

DIFFERENCE between CName and Alias
    - CName can't be used for naked domain names (zone apex record)

i.e. xxyz.com can't be a CName 

Tips:
 - ELBs DO NO have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, always resolve via a DNS name.

 - difference between Alias and CName
    point a zone apex record or named nomain name to an ec2 instance, Alias record is used 
    i.e. xyz.com ==>> EC2 Instance (done via Alias Record)


Common DNS Record Types:
 SOA:   Start of Authority
 NS:    Name Server 
 A:     Alias 
 CName: Canonical,  resolve one domain to another
 MX:    Mail
 PTR:   Reverse of an A Record, look up name against IP address


# Route53 Routing Policies Available on AWS 

Routing Policies:
 - Simple Routing
 - Weighted Routing
 - Latency-based Routing
 - Failover Routing
 - Geolocation Routing
 - Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow Only)
 - Multivalue Answer Routing


Simple Routing Policy:
    - one record with multiple IP Addr

Weighted Routing Policy:
  - split traffice dependent on weight
    10% traffic 1.1.1.1
    75% traffic 2.2.2.2
    15% traffic 3.3.3.3

Associate with Health Check (y/n) 
 - when responding to queries, Route 53 can omit resources that fail health checks.
    - removed until health check passes
 - can be notified if healthcheck failed


Latency Based Routing Policy:
 - route traffic based on lowest network latency for end user
 - create latency resource record for EC2 or ELB

Failover Routing Policy:
 - active / passive setup
    - failover to Secondary if Primary goes down
 - 53 monitors via health check

NOTE: you have to create a Health Check record in Route 53

Geolocation Routing Policy:
 - traffic sent based on geographical locations of users
 - location can be continents or countryes

Geoproximity Routing Policy (Traffic Flow Only): 
 - route traffice based on geo location of users and resources
 - can optionally choose to route traffic via a bias 
    - bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region 
       from which the trafic is routed to a resource

NOTE: MUST BE USED with ROUTE 53 Traffic Flow

Route 53 > Traffic Flow > Traffic Policies


Multivalue Answer Routing Policy:
    - return multiple values i.e. IP Addr
    - specify multiple values for almost any record
        - multivalue answer routing lets you check health of each resource
    - returns only valus for healthy reousrces

Similar to simple routing but puts a health check on each record set.

DNS Summary:

- ELBs do NOT have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, resolves to DNS Name
- Alias can be used a root CName cannot


Quota for domain names in Route 53:    **
 - The limit is 20 for new customers as of March 2021. 
   If you have an existing account and your default limit is 50 now, it will remain at 50. Reference: Amazon Route 53 Quotas. 


## VPC

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
 - logically isolated Cloud to launch resources in virtual netowork you define.
    - complete control over virtual network environment
    - IP address range 
    - subnets 
    - config route tables
    - network gateways

VPC Features:
  - Launch instances into subnet
  - Assign custom IP Address ranges in each subnet
  - Configure route tables between subnets
  - Create internet gateway and attach VPC
  - Better security control over AWS resources
  - Instance security groups
  - Subnet network access control lists

Default VPC vs Custom VPC
 - deafault allows for immediate deploy
 - all subnets in default have a route to the internet
 - Each EC2 instance has both public and private IP address

VPC Peering
 - Allows you to connect one VPC with another via direct network route 
    using private IP addresses

 - Instances behave as if they were on the same network
 
 - Can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in same account
 - Can peer across Regions 
 
 - NOTE: Peering is in a star configuration: 1 central VPC peers with 4 others.
         NO TRANSITIVE PEERING

Tips:
1 Subnet = 1 AZ
    - CANNOT HAVE 1 SUBNET across AZs
    - Can Have 1 AZ have multiple subnets

Security Groups are Statefule
NACLs  are Stateless

Create VPC (what resource created by default)

NOTE: CIDR block size must be between /16 and /28.


Tenancy: Default | Dedicated
NOTE: Dedicated means dedicated hardware / MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

CLI command:

aws ec2 create-vpc \
 --instance-tenancy "default" \
 --cidr-block "10.0.0.0/16" \
 --ipv6-cidr-block-network-border-group "us-east-1" \
 --tag-specifications '{"resourceType":"vpc","tags":[{"key":"Name","value":"knotknull.dev.vpc"},{"key":"env","value":"dev"}]}' 


What was created:
Subnets     : NO
Route Table : YES  (only local routes, four subnets)
Inet gateway: NO
NACLS       : Yes  (Same default Inbound / Outbound Rules but for IPv4 and IPv6.  NOTE: No subnets associated)
Security Grp: Yes  (Default Security Group Created)
                    NOTE:  for Default Security Grop                
                        Inbound :  1 Rule,  all traffic / all IP types
                        Outbound:  2 Rules, all traffic / one each for IPv4 and IPv6

Default resources created for a new VPC: 
  - Route Table
  - NACL 
  - Security Grp 
  - Router


NOTE: availability zones are randomized per account 
  i.e.  acct #1 us-east-1a  is not the same as acct #2 us-east-1a

NETWORK NOTES: 
Only 251 out of 256 addresses available

Amazon Reserves 5 IP Addresses:
  10.0.0.0   - Network   Address 
  10.0.0.1   - VPC Router
  10.0.0.2   - DNS Server
                    - base of VPC network range + 2
                    - base of each subnet range + 2
  10.0.0.3   - Reserved for future use
  10.0.0.255 - Broadcast Address


Make on e subnet have Auto-assing public IP addresses

VPC > Subnet > Select > Action > Edit Subnet Settings
 - enable auto-assign publc IPv4 addresses

Add Internet Gateway to new VPC: 
Create Internet Gateway

Once created, attach to VPC
VPC> Internet Gatways > Actions > Attach 

aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --vpc-id "vpc-07faa2b86804d88c8" --internet-gateway-id "igw-0076d4f89018b05bf" --region us-east-1

NOTE: can only have one Internet Gateway per VPC


Create Route to Internet via Route Table
VPC > Route Tables > instance 

NOTE:  keep main route table private and create route table for public access

VPC > Route Tables > Create Route Table

once created, add route to internet gateway

VPC > Route Tables > Instance > Edit Routes > Add Route
destination: 0.0.0.0/0 
target     : igw ... (new internet gateway assocaited with VPC)

associate subnet to new public route table
VPC > Route Tables > Instance > Edit Routes > Subnet Associaions > Edit Subnet Associations
Associate Public Route table with subnet that had set Auto Assign Public IP Addr 

create 2 ec2, one public, one private




NOTE: Security Groups DO NOT SPAN VPCs
Review: 

Default resources created for a new VPC: 
  - Route Table
  - NACL 
  - Security Grp 
  - Router

NO SUBNETS or Internet Gateway

Amazon Reserves 5 IP Addresses:
  10.0.0.0   - Network   Address 
  10.0.0.1   - VPC Router
  10.0.0.2   - DNS Server
                    - base of VPC network range + 2
                    - base of each subnet range + 2
  10.0.0.3   - Reserved for future use
  10.0.0.255 - Broadcast Address

Only 1 Intgernet Gateway per VPC

Security Groups CAN NOT SPAN VPCs



SSH Notes:

1. Use ssh-agent forwarding from bastion host to ec2 instances

2. On client add key to keychain 
    ssh-add -K ssh_key.pem 

3. Can verify keys available to ssh-agent use:
    ssh-add -L 

4. Connect to bastion host using -A option.   Enables SSH agent forwarding. 
   Local SSH agent responds to public-key challenge when ssh from bastion to EC2 instance.
    ssh -A user@bastion_host    # Agent Forwarding

6. Once in bastion host, connect to ec2 instance 
    ssh  user@ec2_instance


NOTE:  ssh-agent will try all keys until successful, however only 5 attempts allowed. 
       Make sure there are not more than 5 keys in ssh-agent by chcking:
         ssh-add -L

# NAT Instance vs NAT Gateway

Network Adress Translation

NAT Instance:  EC2 instance
NAT Gateway:   HA Gateway service
               - private subnets can communicate w/ Internet without being public


Can create a NAT instance via Amazon Linux image via: 
 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/work-with-nat-instances.html#create-nat-ami

Or 

You can use a NAT Gateway


TIP:

- When creating a NAT instnce:  Disable Source / Destination Check on the instance
- NAT instance put be in public subnet
- Must be a route OUT of private subnet to the NAT instance
- NAT instances ALWAYS behind a security group

NAT gateways
- redundant inside AZ 
- Only ONE NAT Gateway in an AZ  (can't span)
- start at 5 Gbps and scale to 45 Gbps
- No patching
- Not associated with security groups
- Automatically assigned a public IP address
- Update route tables
- Create NAT Gateway per AZ per HA

# Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) vs Security Groups

New NACL deny all traffic inbound / outbound by default


Ephemeral ports for NAT Gateway, port assigned for the client end of a client-server communication.  (i.e. the port that the client gets)
NAT Gateway Ephemeral Ports:  1024 - 65535

Rules are being evaluated by rule number lowest to greateest and then the DENY rules
    - If you have a DENY first (lower number) followed by an ALLOW later for same rule the DENY takes precedence

MAIN THING:  NACLS can deal with ports and IP Addrs and Security Groups cannot


Subnet can only have associated with 1 NACL
NACL can have man subnets


NOTE:  NACLs evaluated BEFORE security groups 
     A DENY in NACL won't ever make it to a security group

VPC automatically comes with default NACL
    - default allows all inbound and outbound

Custom NACL stargs with all inbound / outbound traffice as DENY

Each subnets associated with 1 NACL
 - if NOT defined it is associated with default NACL
