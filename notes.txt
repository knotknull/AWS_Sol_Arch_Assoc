Notes for acloud.guru AWS Solution Architect Associate training







Availability Zone == Data Center, can have multiple DCs in an AZ

Region: geographical area, each Region consists of 2 or more AZ.

Edge Location: endpoints for AWS which is used to cache content i.e. CloudFront (CDN)


Main course topics: compute, storage, databases, network, content delivery, security, IAM, compliance


## Identity and Access Management / S3

IAM: manage users and level of access to AWS Console



IAM Features: 
    - Centralized controle of AWS Account
    - Shared access to your AWS Account
    - Granular perms
    - Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn)
    - Multifactor Authentication
    - Provide temproary access for users / devices / services
    - Password rotation policy
    - Integrates with AWS services
    - Supports PCI DSS Compliance


Key IAM Aspects: 
    Users:    end users sucha as people, employees etc
    Groups:   collection of users, each user in the group will inherit the permissions of the group
    Policies: policies made up of policy documents (JSON that gives perms to what a User, Group, or Role is able to do)
    Roles :   create roles and assign to resources



## IAM LAB

> Console > Search > IAM
Upper right shows login console: 

https://iamwhatiam.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

NOTE:  I changed it to knotknull for the alias:
https://knotknull.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


Root Account:  Account that created the AWS account == "God Mode"

Policies > choose a police (i.e. Administrator Access), click on "+" for JSON: 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

- IAM is universal, does not apply to regions
- root account has full Admin Access
- new user has not access, can add console and programtic access

## S3 

Simple Storage Service 
- object storage
    - key (name) / value (data)
    - version ID
    - metadata
    - ACLs
    - toreents

- data spread across multiple devices / facilities
- size: 0 bytes to 5TB files **
- unlimited storage
- files stored in buckets (think folder)
- universal namespace: must be globally unique
- successful upload:  HTTP 200 code
NOTE: not suitable for installing an OS on 


# S3 Consistency:
    - Read after Write for PUTS of new objects
    - Eventural Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (propogates)
        - could get older version or deleted file


# S3 Versioning: 
    Can version buckets and suspend versioning:
    - versioning give a version to each new put a key
    - suspending versioning makes the version id null 
        - if there versions without a null version id they will remain
        - putting a new entry with a key that has a null will overwrite the null key version
    - MFA Delete
    - Encryption

# S3 Guarantees:
    - 99.9% Availability **
    - 99.9999999999% Durability **    (11 9's )


# S3 Storage Classes

- S3 Standard
    - 99.99 Availability / 99.9999999 durability
        - stored redundantly across multiple devices / multiple facilities 
            - sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently

- S3 IA (infreqeuently accessed)
    - less frequent access
    - requires rapid access when needed
    - lower fee than S3, charged retrieval fee


- S3 One Zone - IA (infreqeuently accessed)
    - low cost IA
    - don't require multiple AZs resiliency
NOTE: was known as RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)


- S3 Intelligent Tiering
    - optimize costs by automatically moving data to most cost effective access tier,
        - no performance impact / no operational overhead

- S3 Glacier
    - low cost storage for data archiving
        - retrieval time from minutes to hours

- S3 Deep Archive
    - lowest cost storage 
        - retrieval time 12 hours

S3 Charges: 
- storage
- requests
- management priceing (tiers)
- data transfer
- transfer acceleration
    - use CloudFront to speed up bucket transfers
- cross region replication



Buckets viewed globally but can be housed regionally

Access:   **
    - Bucket Policies: applies across the entire bucket
    - Object Policies: applies to individual files
    - IAM policies to Users and groups: applies to users / groups


# S3 pricing
    - storage
    - requests / data retrieval
    - data transfer
    - mgmt & replication

S3 and S3 Intelligent Tiering is same for frequent access, less for IA tier
cost hierarchy: 
    S3 Std > S3 IA > S3 IA > S3 One Zone IA > Glacier > Glacier Deep Archive  **


# S3 Security / Encryption

    - Bucket Policies
    - ACL (to object)

S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs make to bucket.

Encryption in Transit 
    - SSL / TLS (https)

Encryption at Rest 
 - Server Side
    - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3: Amazon manages keys
    - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS: manage keys with AWS Key Management Service
    - Server Side Encryption w/ Customer Provided Keys:  SSE-C
    - NEW: Dual-Layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS Service Keys (DSSE-KMS)

 - Client Side Encryption
    - customer encrypts and uploads

Can encrypt individual objects and at bucket level.


# S3 Versioning 
    - stores all versions of an object (soft delete)
    - once enabled, CANNOT DISABLE, only suspend  **
    - lifecycle rules
    - MFA Delete


Note: latest version is available (can be made public)
      - lower versions not made available/public unless specifically made so
      DELETING the DELETE MARKER makes most recent version available  **

# S3 Lifecycle Rules
    - Automates moving objects between storage tiers 
        - can be used w/ versioning 
        - current and prior versions
buckets > bucket > management > lifecycle configuration > create rule 

# S3 Object Lock & Glacier Vault Lock
    Object Lock: write once, ream many (WORM)
        - prevent object from being deleted / modified for fixed amount of time or indefinitely 

        - Governance Mode: users can't overwrite or delete and object version or alter lock settings  **
                - special perms needed

        - Compliance Mode: protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by ANY USER (including root user)  **
            - ensures object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period (i.e. 7 Years)

        retention period: protects object version for fixed amount of time  
            - timestamp of expiration kep in version metadata

        - Legal Hold: prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted
                - does not have a retention period.  In place until removed
                - can be applied / removed with s3:PutObjectLegalHold perm

    Glacier Vault Lock: deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier Vaults 
            with Vault Lock Policy. 
                - specify controls in a Vault Lock Policy
                    - policy locked from future edits
- Object Lock == WORM
- Object Lock applied to objects or bucket
- governance mode and compliance mode
- Glacier Vault Lock = compliance controls for Glacier Vaults
    - Vault Lock policy locked for edits



# S3 Performance
    S3 Prefix:   between bucket name and object name 
        i.e.  /bucketname/folder1/subfolder2/xyz.txt  >> Prefix = /folder1/subfolder2


S3 latency:  1st byte within 100 - 200 ms

Throughput Requests can achieve: 
    - 3500 PUT / COPY / POST / DELETE   per PREFIX  **
    - 5500 GET/HEAD requests per second per PREFIX  **


NOTE: can get better performance by spreading reads across different prefixes i.e.:
    - 2 prefixes (/folder1/subfolder2) 11,000 requests / sec
    - 4 prefixes (/folder1/subfolder2/dir1/dir2 ) 22,000 requests / sec

MORE PREFIXES == BETTER PERFORMANCE !!  **

SSE-KMS Quotas: 

 - KMS Request rates: 
    - SSE-KMS has KMS limits 
        - upload   file:  GenerateDataKey in KMS API
        - download file:  Decrypt in KMS API

KMS Quota is region specific **
    - 5500 or 10k or 30k requests per second  **

NOTE: CANNOT REQUEST QUOTA INCREASE FOR KMS 


Uploads

    Multi-part uploads:
        - recommended for files over 100 MB  **
        - required for files over  5 GB   

Downloads:
    S3 Byte-Range fetches: 
        - parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges
        - can speed up downloads
        - download partial file

# S3 Select & Glacier Select
    S3 Select:  retrieve subtset of data from object using simple SQL expressions
        - retrieve only data you need
            - performance increase 
                - up to 400% faster  ** 
                - up to 80% cheaper

    Glacier Select:  Similar to S3 Select but run against Glacier

# AWS Organizations and Consolidated billing

AWS Organizations: account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts 
    into an organization to centally manage. 
    Accounts under organization unit under ROOT  with policies at the OU and account
OU = Organizational Unit

{Organization}
---------------
[Policy]    [ROOT]          
      |   /        \   +---[Policy]              [Policy]
     [OU]           \  |                            /
    /    \           [OU]----------------------+   /       
[Account]  \           |                       |  /
             [OU]    [Account]                [OU]---------+
           /      \                          / |           |
     [Account]    [Account]         [Account] [Account] [Account]      

Consolidated Billing: 
    - Paying account (cannot access sub resources) linked to AWS accounts


                        +------[Test/Dev]
                        |
    [Paying Account] ---+------[Production]
                        |
                        +------[Back Office]

Consolidates usage for volume discounts

- Root Account should always have MFA
- Paying account should be for billing only 
    - do no deploy resources to paying account
- Service Control Policies on OU or individual account  **
    - enable / disable AWS Services


# Share S3 Buckets Across Accounts
    - 3 ways to share S3 Buckets across acounts  **
        1. Bucket Policies and IAM
            - across the entire bucket
            - programatic access only
        2. Bucket ACLs and IAM 
            - individual objects
            - programatic access only
        3. Cross-account IAM Roles
            - programatic access 
            - console access 

IAM > Roles > Create Role
    - Another AWS Account
    - Attach permission policies to role
        i.e. AmazonS3FullAccess
    - Role Name > Create Role

NOTE:  Give this link to users who can switch roles in the console   **
    user logs in an clicks "Switch Role" under id or use link


# Bucket replication
S3 > buckets > bucket > Replication Rule > Create Replication Rule

NOTE: Source and replicated buckets need to be versioned !! **
    - Detele markers are not replicated 
    - Permissions on source bucket will replicate across regions

# S3 Transfer Acceleration
    - utilizes CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate uploads
        - use distinct URL to upload to edge location which is then transfered to S3


# DataSync
    - move large amounts of data to AWS
    - AWS DataSync Agent  (on prem)
    - locally connects to NAS or SMB filesystem
        - copy to AWS 
        - write from AWS 
    - Connects to AWS Services: 
        - S3
        - EFS
        - FSx for Windows File Server
    - Hourly, daily or weekly
NOTE: can replicate EFS to EFS 


# CloudFront
 - Content Delivery Network
    - pushes contact to local Points of Presence
    - Edge Location:  where content is cached
        - Can Read and Write to Edge Locations
    - Origin       :  Origin of all files distributed via ECN
        - bucket
        - ec2 instance 
        - ELB
        - Route 53
    - Distributon  :  Name of the CDN
        - collection of Edge Locations

    - Can deliver:
        - Static
        - Dynamic
        - Streaming
        - Interactive content

    - Objects cached for the TTL (Time To Live) 

    Web Distribution:  Used for websites
    RTMP :  Media Streaming

NOTE: Can clear cached objects, will be charged


Can restrict access via signed URLs or signed cookies

Domain Name created for Cached Content
i.e. https://d16s698dkl8k6u.cloudfront.net

https://d16s698dkl8k6u.cloudfront.net/README.txt

NOTE:  can invalidate the Distribution:  CloudFront > Distributions > Invalidations


# CloudFront Signed URLs and Cookies

    - Signed URLs  :  1 file   = 1 URL
    - Signed Cookie:  1 cookie = multiple files


Attach policy to 
    - URL Expiration
    - IP Ranges
    - Trusted Signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLS)


Origin Access Identity (OAI):  
    - users access CloudFront which then access S3 bucket via OAI 


CloudFront SDK generates Signed URL

    - key pari of Signed URL is account wide (managed by ROOT)

S3 Signed URL 
    - request as IAM user who creates presigned URL 
    - limited lifetime

Origin is EC2 use CloudFront
Origin is S3  use S3 Signed URL

security group is a "virtual firewall"

Termination Protection turned off by default 

Root EBS volume will be default deleted when instance terminated
    - Root valume can be encrypted


# Security Groups

- firewall for a resource 
    - change to a security group rule takes place immediately
    NOTE: security groups are STATEFULL 
            - creating an inbound rule will allow for the corresponding outbound rule 
                i.e. HTTP / 80 IN will automatically allow HTTP / 80 OUT 

NOTE:  You can't block a particular port or IP address in a security group, can only do that with NACLs
       Security groups block everything by DEFAULT.

       NACLs are STATELESS, need to create both inbound and outbound rule

- can attach more than one security group to an EC2 instance

- All Inbound  traffic BLOCKED by default
- All Outbound traffic ALLOWED by default
- Security Groups are STATEFUL 
    - those allowed IN are also allowed OUT
- Cannot block specific ports or IP addresses using Security Groups
    - use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

- Can have any number of EC2 instances in a security group
- Can have multiple security groups attached to an EC2 instances 
- Can only specify "ALLOW" rules in a Security Group 
    - default of a SECURITY GROUP is to "DENY" everything


# EBS

- Elastic Block Store 
    - persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances
        - virtual hard disk in cloud
    - automatically replicated within its Availability Zone

5 Types of EBS Storage:
    - General Purpose (SSD)
    - Provisioned IOPS (SSD)
    - Throughput Optimised Hard Disk Drive  (Physical Magnetic drive)
    - Cold Hard Disk Drive
    - Magnetic
