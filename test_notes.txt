Geoproximity and Geolocation routing policies: review


Name limit value of DynamoDB
     - combined value and name limit for DDB is 400kb


Volume Gateway:
  - stored volumes: low latency
  - cached volumes: caches to S3

When using a Dedicated Instance, which of the following tenancy attributes are you able to transition between by stopping the instance and starting it again?
Dedicated & Host ??
The tenancy of an instance can only be changed between variants of ‘dedicated' tenancy hosting. It cannot be changed from or to default tenancy hosting. Dedicated Instances.


Which of the following strategies does AWS use to deliver the promised levels of DynamoDB performance?
AWS DynamoDB delivers predictable performance brought on by the use of Solid State Drives, better known as SSDs.
DynamoDB makes use of parallel processing to achieve predictable performance. You visualise each partition as an independent DB server of fixed size. Each responsible for a defined block of data. In SQL terminology it is called sharding.


What are the available AWS Support Plans?
Basic (included for all AWS customers), Developer, Business, and Enterprise are the available AWS Support Plans. Reference: Compare AWS Support Plans.


What is the maximum response time for a Business Level 'production down' Support Case?
The business support plan has a maximum response time of < 1 hour for "production system down" cases.



You are a systems administrator and you need to monitor the health of your production environment. 
You decide to do this using CloudWatch. However, you notice that you cannot see the health of every important metric 
in the default dashboard. When monitoring the health of your EC2 instances, for which of the following metrics 
do you need to design a custom CloudWatch metric?
 - Memory Usage

Remember, under the shared security model, AWS can see the instance, but not inside the instance to indicate how it is doing. 
AWS can see that you have memory, but not how much of the memory is being used. In the case of CPU, AWS can see how 
much of CPU you are using, but cannot see what you are using it for.



Route 53, the AWS implementation of DNS, supports a number of Routing policies. Which of the following are valid Policy types?


Failover Routing Policy
Geolocation Routing Policy
Geoproximity Routing Policy
Simple Routing Policy
Latency Routing Policy


You are a consultant planning to deploy DynamoDB across three AZs. Your lead DBA is concerned about data consistency. 
Which of the following do you advise the lead DBA to do?

To ask the development team to code for strongly consistent reads. As the consultant, you will advise the CTO it may 
have higher latency than eventually consistent reads.

When you request a strongly consistent read, DynamoDB returns a response with the most up-to-date data, 
reflecting the updates from all prior write operations that were successful. However, this consistency comes with 
some disadvantages such as read might not be available if there is a network delay or outage, higher latency than 
eventually consistent reads, global secondary indexes not supported, and use of more throughput capacity than 
eventually consistent reads.

S3 - IA
The storage savings between IA and OneZone-IA are about $0.0025 this is small compared to the $10 for licensing 
if many files are lost. The durability of S3 - IA and S3 - OneZone-IA is the same: 99.999999999%., but there is 
far more of a risk of high costs if it is in one zone. S3 - IA guards against that possibility.


A user of your web-site makes an HTTP request to access a static resource on your server. 
The request is automatically redirected to the nearest CloudFront server. For some reason, 
the requested resource does not exist on the CloudFront server. Which of the following is true?

CloudFront will query the origin server and then cache the resource on the edge location.
CloudFront checks its cache for the requested files. If the files are in the cache, CloudFront returns them to the user. 
If the files are not in the cache, it does the following: a) CloudFront compares the request with the specifications in 
your distribution and forwards the request for the files to your origin server for the corresponding file type—for example, 
to your Amazon S3 bucket for image files and to your HTTP server for HTML files. b) The origin servers send the files back 
to the edge location. c) As soon as the first byte arrives from the origin, CloudFront begins to forward the files to the user. 
CloudFront also adds the files to the cache in the edge location for the next time someone requests those files. 
Reference: How CloudFront delivers content to your users.


n order to keep costs low, they run the analysis for only a few hours in the early hours of the morning, using spot instances for the task nodes. The core nodes are on-demand instances. Lately however the EMR jobs have been failing. This is due to spot instances being unexpectedly terminated. Which of the following is recommended to have the best experience in terms of availability using the Spot service?
choose 2
- Use proactive capacity rebalancing.
- Use the capacity optimized allocation strategy.

Correct Answer

Capacity Rebalancing helps you maintain workload availability by proactively augmenting your fleet with a new Spot Instance before a running Spot Instance receives the two-minute Spot Instance interruption notice. When Capacity Rebalancing is enabled, Auto Scaling or Spot Fleet attempts to proactively replace Spot Instances that have received a rebalance recommendation, providing the opportunity to rebalance your workload to new Spot Instances that are not at elevated risk of interruption. Capacity Rebalancing complements the capacity optimized allocation strategy (which is designed to help find the most optimal spare capacity) and the mixed instances policy (which is designed to enhance availability by deploying instances across multiple instance types running in multiple Availability Zones). Reference: Best practices for EC2 Spot.

Allocation strategies in Auto Scaling groups help you to provision your target capacity without the need to manually look for the Spot Instance pools with spare capacity. AWS recommends using the capacity optimized strategy because this strategy automatically provisions instances from the most-available Spot Instance pools. You can also take advantage of the capacity optimized allocation strategy in Spot Fleet. Because your Spot Instance capacity is sourced from pools with optimal capacity, this decreases the possibility that your Spot Instances are reclaimed. Reference: Best practices for EC2 Spot.


How does AWS deliver high availability for DynamoDB?
DynamoDB data is automatically replicated across multiple AZs.


Which options are valid to protect your Amazon S3 data at rest using server-side encryption?
choose 3 
- Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
- Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
- Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

With Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption, when you access your objects. For more information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).

Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits and charges for using this service. There are separate permissions for the use of a CMK that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom. Additionally, you can create and manage customer managed CMKs or use AWS managed CMKs that are unique to you, your service, and your Region. For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

When you use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data. For more information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).


In order to run your application leveraging those AMI's in your backup region, which process would you follow?

- Copy the AMI from us-west-2 to us-west-1. After the copy operation is complete, apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and security group configurations.

AWS does not copy launch permissions, user-defined tags, or security group rules from the source AMI to the new AMI. 
After the copy operation is complete, you can apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and security group configurations 
to the new AMI.


By definition, a public subnet within a VPC is one that ________.
 - Has at least one route in its routing table that uses an Internet Gateway (IGW).




When editing Amazon S3 bucket permissions (policies and ACLs), to whom does the concept of the "resource owner" refer?

- The "resource owner" refers to the AWS account that creates Amazon S3 buckets and objects.

The "resource owner" concept comes into play especially when setting or locking down access to various objects. Reference: Amazon S3 bucket and object ownership





They store their research data on S3. However, an intern recently deleted some critical files accidentally. 
You've been asked to prevent this from happening in the future. Which of the following solutions can be used to 
prevent accidental data loss?

- Enable S3 versioning on the bucket & enable MFA Delete on the bucket.

To prevent or mitigate future accidental deletions, consider the following features: Enable versioning to keep historical versions of an object and MFA Delete to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) when deleting an object version. Reference: How can I audit deleted or missing objects from my Amazon S3 bucket?



VPC with a subnet that has a CIDR block of 10.0.3.0/28 address range. Inside this subnet, you have 2 web servers, 2 application servers, 2 database servers, and a NAT. You have configured an Autoscaling group on the two web servers to automatically scale when the CPU utilization goes above 90%. Several days later you notice that autoscaling is no longer deploying new instances into the subnet, despite the CPU utilization of all web servers being at 100%. Which of the following answers may offer an explanation?

- AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block.
- Your Autoscaling Group (ASG) has provisioned too many EC2 instances and has exhausted the number of internal IP addresses available in the subnet.

A /28 subnet will only have 16 addresses available. AWS reserve both the first four and last IP addresses in each subnet’s 
CIDR block. It is likely that your autoscaling group has provisioned too many EC2 instances and you have run out of 
internal private IP addresses.



You successfully configure VPC Peering between VPC A and VPC B. You then establish an IGW and a Direct Connect connection in 
VPC B. Can instances in VPC A connect to your corporate office via the Direct Connect service, and connect to the 
Internet via the IGW?

- VPC peering does not support edge to edge routing.

VPC peering only routes traffic between source and destination VPCs. VPC peering does not support edge to edge routing. Reference: Unsupported VPC peering configurations.


Which of the following database technologies are supported by RDS.
choose 3
- Oracle
- MariaDB
- Aurora

RDS supports the MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLServer, Oracle, and Aurora database engines.



However, you are told that the bucket name is already taken. What should you do to resolve this?
 - Bucket names are global, not regional. This is a popular bucket name and is already taken. You must choose another bucket name.


You have created 15 users for your system administrators. What further steps do you need to take to enable your 
system administrators to get access to the AWS console in a secure fashion?
choose 2
- Generate a password for each administrator user and give these passwords to your system administrators.
- Have each user set up multi-factor authentication once they have logged in to the console.

You should generate a password for each administrator user and give these passwords to your system administrators. You should then have each user set up multi-factor authentication once they have been able to log in to the console. You cannot use the secret access key and access key id to log in to the AWS console; rather, these credentials are used to call Amazon API’s.

You should generate a password for each administrator user and give these passwords to your system administrators. It is best practice to require the user to change their password after the initial logon. You should then have each user set up multi-factor authentication once they have been able to log in to the console. You cannot use the secret access key and access key id to log in to the AWS console; rather, these credentials are used to call Amazon APIs.





Which of the following features only relate to Spread Placement Groups?

- A spread placement group supports a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone.

Spread placement groups have a specific limitation that you can only have a maximum of 7 running instances per Availability Zone 
and therefore this is the only correct option. Deploying instances in a single Availability Zone is unique to 
Cluster Placement Groups only and therefore is not correct. The other two remaining options are common to all placement group 
types and so are not specific to Spread Placement Groups.




Which AWS service does not allow native encryption of data while at rest?

- Elasticache for Memcached

Elasticache for Memcached does not offer native encryption of data at rest. For a managed caching solution with encryption at rest, you can use Elasticache for Redis.



Which of the following Amazon S3 Storage Classes offer 99.999999999% (11 x 9s) durability?

- Standard, Standard-Infrequent Access, One Zone-Infrequent Access

Currently the S3 Classes are; Standard, Standard-Infrequent Access, One Zone-Infrequent Access, Reduced Redundancy Storage 
and for archive, Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive. Reduced Redundancy Storage is the only S3 Class that does not 
offer 99.999999999% durability and therefore any of the answers that contain Reduced Redundancy Storage cannot be correct.


Which of the following are valid Route 53 routing policies?
choose 3

- Simple
- Weighted
- Latency

Route 53 has the following routing policies - Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Multivalue answer, Geoproximity. and Geolocation

What is true about Amazon S3 URLs for accessing a bucket?
choose 3
- Path-Style URLs will be eventually deprecated in favor of virtual hosted-style URLs for S3 bucket access
- Path-Style URLs (such as https://s3.Region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/key name) are supported to access an S3 bucket
- Virtual-host-style URLs (such as: https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key name) are supported to access an S3 bucket

Path-Style URLs will be eventually deprecated. Virtual-host-style URLs are strongly recommended.
Reference: Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan – The Rest of the Story.
Both virtual-host-style and Path-Style URLs are supported, but path-style URLs will be eventually deprecated in favor of virtual hosted-style URLs for S3 bucket access. DNS compliant names are also recommended.
Reference: Virtual hosting of buckets.
Both Virtual-host-Style and Path-Style URLs are supported, but path-style URLs will be eventually deprecated in favor of virtual hosted-style URLs for S3 bucket access. DNS compliant names are also recommended.



messages presented to the support team are not arriving in the order in which they were generated, and occasionally they are 
receiving a duplicate copy of the message. You know that this is due to the way that the underlying SQS standard queue 
service is being used to manage messages. Which of the following are correct explanations?

choose 2

- SQS uses multiple hosts, and each host holds only a portion of all the messages. When a staff member calls for their next 
  message, the consumer process does not see all the hosts or all the messages. As such, messages are not necessarily delivered 
  in the order in which they were generated.

- If an agent abandons a message or takes a break before finishing with a message, it will be offered in the queue again. 
  In order to ensure that no message is lost, a message will persist in the SQS queue until it is processed successfully or 
  until the message retention quota is reached. 

Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order.

When a consumer receives and processes a message from a queue, the message remains in the queue. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically delete the message. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The visibility timeout begins when Amazon SQS returns a message. During this time, the consumer processes and deletes the message. However, if the consumer fails before deleting the message and your system doesn't call the DeleteMessage action for that message before the visibility timeout expires, the message becomes visible to other consumers and the message is received again. If a message must be received only once, your consumer should delete it within the duration of the visibility timeout.


Attached to your EC2 instances are multiple EBS volumes, and you must ensure this data is encrypted. 
Which of the following options will allow you to do this?
choose 3
- Use third party volume encryption tools.
- Encrypt the data using native encryption tools available in the operating system.
- Encrypt your data inside your application, before storing it on EBS.



Encryption by default is a Region-specific setting. It needs to be enabled to encrypt EBS volumes when instances are launched.
Correct Answer
Encrypting Amazon EBS volumes attached to Windows instances can be done using BitLocker or Encrypted File System (EFS) as well as open source applications like TrueCrypt. Some common block-level open source encryption solutions for Linux are Loop-AES, dm-crypt (with or without) LUKS, and TrueCrypt.
This is a valid approach to protect sensitive files inside an EBS volume.





​A client is concerned that someone other than approved administrators is trying to gain access to the Linux web app instances in their VPC. She asks what sort of network access logging can be added. Which of the following might you recommend?​

- Create a flow log for a VPC, subnet, or individual network interface. Publish the flow log data to either Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. 

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces 
in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. After you've created a flow log, you can 
retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination. You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. 
If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, each network interface in that subnet or VPC is monitored.


You have been asked by your employer to create an identical copy of your production environment in another Region for 
disaster recovery purposes. In the list below, which AWS resources would you NOT need to recreate, because they are 
available universally across the console?

- Identity Access Management Roles
- Route 53

Identity Access Management Roles are available universally across the AWS management console and do not need to be recreated in a different region.
Route 53 configurations are available universally across the AWS management console and do not need to be recreated in a different region.

you can use Elasticache for Redis.

Being automatically replicated across multiple AZs makes DynamoDB highly available.

Remember, under the shared security model, AWS can see the instance, but not inside the instance to indicate how it is doing. 
AWS can see that you have memory, but not how much of the memory is being used. In the case of CPU, AWS can see how much of CPU 
you are using, but cannot see what you are using it for.


The visibility timeout controls how long a message is invisible in the queue while it is being worked on by a processing instance. 
This interval should not be confused with how long the message can remain in the queue.

Route 53 has the following routing policies: Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Multivalue answer, Geoproximity. and Geolocation

A volume gateway provides cloud-backed storage volumes that you can mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) 
devices from your on-premises application servers. The gateway supports stored volumes if you need low-latency access to your 
entire dataset. You can configure your on-premises gateway to store all your data locally, then asynchronously back up 
point-in-time snapshots of this data to Amazon S3. 







You are reviewing Change Control requests, and you note that there is a change designed to reduce costs by updating the Amazon SQS "WaitTimeSeconds" attribute. What does this mean?


he maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds. Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty response


When coding a routine to upload to S3, you have the option of using either single part upload or multipart upload. Identify all the possible reasons below to use Multipart upload.

Choose 4

- Multipart upload delivers the ability to begin an upload before you know the final object size.
- Multipart upload delivers the ability to pause and resume object uploads.
- Multipart upload delivers quick recovery from network issues.
- Multipart upload delivers improved throughput.


How long can a message be retained in an SQS Queue?
- Messages can be retained in queues for up to 14 days.



With EBS, I can ________.
Choose 2

Create an encrypted snapshot from an unencrypted snapshot by creating an encrypted copy of the unencrypted snapshot.

Create an encrypted volume from a snapshot of another encrypted volume.



Which native AWS service will act as a file system mounted on an S3 bucket?
File Gateway
A file gateway supports a file interface into Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and combines a service and a virtual software appliance. By using this combination, you can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB).


The software appliance, or gateway, is deployed into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points.


Change designed to reduce wasted CPU cycles by increasing the value of your Amazon SQS "VisibilityTimeout" attribute. What does this mean?

Poor timing of SQS processes can significantly impact the cost effectiveness of the solution. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours.


A NAT instance sends and retrieves traffic on behalf of instances in a private subnet. As a result, source/destination checks on the NAT instance must be disabled to allow the sending and receiving traffic for the private instances. Route 53 resolves DNS names, so it would not help here. Traffic that is originating from your NAT instance will not pass through an ELB. Instead, it is sent directly from the public IP address of the NAT Instance out to the Internet.


Virtual-host-style URLs and Path-Style URLs (soon to be retired) are supported by AWS. DNS compliant names are recommended for the URLs to access S3.


By default, all EC2 instances are monitored by CloudWatch. Using the default settings, how many minutes elapse between when metrics are sent to CloudWatch? Using the detailed option, how many minutes would elapse between metrics being sent to CloudWatch?

5 minutes, 1 minute


You have created a VPC that contains two EC2 instances in different availability zones. Both are running web servers, hosting the same content. These web servers will be accessible via the internet. Which of the following DNS configurations could you consider?

Using an ALB will provide a very fault tolerant setup. When creating a record in Route 53 to other AWS resources, including ALB's, you should use Alias records where available.

The alternate option of attaching Elastic IPs directly to the instances with an "A" record accomplishes similar results, but doesn't incur the cost of an ALB.


REVIEW TENANCY instance vs. default
How do you revert your instance tenancy attribute of a VPC to default for new launched EC2 instances?​
Modify the instance tenancy attribute of your VPC from dedicated to default using the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the Amazon EC2 API.


Which of the following services should you provision in multiple availability zones in order to achieve high availability?

S3, SQS & DynamoDB are already built in a fault tolerant fashion, you do not need to provision these services across multiple availability zones. Therefore the correct answers are RDS and EC2

You have been engaged by a company to design and lead the migration to an AWS environment. An argument has broken out about how to meet future Backup & Archive requirements and how to transition. The Security Manager and CTO are concerned about backup continuity and the ability to continue to access old tape archives. The Senior engineer is adamant that there is no way to retain the old backup solution in the AWS environment, and that they will lose access to all the current archives. What information can you share that will satisfy both parties in a cost-effective manner?


Suggest that during transition, a second AWS Tape Gateway (VTL) solution could be commissioned in the customer's new VPC and integrated with existing VTS. At the same time, the existing Enterprise Backup Solution could be used to perform tape-to-tape copies to migrate the Archives from tape to VTL/VTS virtual tape.


Meet with both parties and brief them on the AWS Tape Gateway (VTL) solution. Explain that it can initially be installed in the on-premises environment utilizing the existing enterprise backup product to start the transition without losing access to the existing backups and archives. Over the duration of the migration, most (if not all) the backup cycles will be replaced by the new VTL & VTS tapes.




Provide the required access for the auditing tasks. Which of the following might you do?

- Create an IAM User with a policy that can Read Security Group and NACL settings.
Create an IAM user for the auditor and explain that the firewall functionality is implemented as stateful Security Groups, and stateless subnet NACLs.







Amazon ElastiCache can fulfill a number of roles. Choose the operations from the following list which can be implemented using ElastiCache for Redis.

- In-Memory Data Store
- Pub/Sub
- Sorted Sets

However, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis doesn't support multithreaded 


Amazon Web Services offers 4 different levels of support. Which of the following are valid support levels?
The correct answers are Enterprise, Business, Developer. Plus the Basic free level. Remember that Free Tier is a Billing rebate not an account or support level.



You work for a busy real estate company, and you need to protect your data stored on S3 from accidental deletion. Which of the following actions might you take to achieve this?
The best answers are to allow versioning on the bucket and to protect the objects by configuring MFA-protected API access.


- You need to store some easily re-creatable objects on S3. With rapid access times and cost-effectiveness in mind, which S3 storage class should you consider?
S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.


You've been commissioned to develop a high-availability application with a stateless web tier. Identify the most cost-effective means of reaching this end.

- With proper scripting and scaling policies, running EC2 On-Demand instances behind the Spot instances will deliver the most cost-effective solution because On-Demand instances will only spin up if the Spot instances are not available. DynamoDB lends itself to supporting stateless web/app installations better than RDS .



To save money, you quickly stored some data in one of the attached volumes of an EC2 instance and stopped it for the weekend. When you returned on Monday and restarted your instance, you discovered that your data was gone. Why might that be?

The volume was ephemeral, block-level storage. Data on an instance store volume is lost if an instance is stopped.
The most likely answer is that the EC2 instance had an instance store volume attached to it. Instance store volumes are ephemeral, meaning that data in attached instance store volumes is lost if the instance stops.



requires new instances of the Auto Scaling group to identify their public and private IP addresses. How can you achieve this?
Using a Curl or Get Command to get the latest meta-data from http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/





You need to restrict access to an S3 bucket. Which of the following methods can you use to do so?

Access Control Lists for S3 (Permissions)
S3 Bucket policies


You have been asked to deploy an application on a small number of EC2 instances. The application must be placed across multiple Availability Zones and should also minimize the chance of underlying hardware failure. Which of the following options would provide this solution?

Spread Placement Groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances which need to be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a Spread Placement Group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same underlying hardware. 

What data formats are used to create CloudFormation templates?
- YAML
- JSON


Your company likes the idea of storing files on AWS. Your company would like to store common/recently used files locally, while storing long-term colder data in AWS. Which Storage Gateway configuration would you use to achieve both of these ends?

- File Gateway
- Volume Gateway - Cached volumes

A file gateway simplifies file storage in Amazon S3, integrates to existing applications through industry-standard file system protocols, and provides a cost-effective alternative to on-premises storage. It also provides low-latency access to data through transparent local caching.

Cached volumes allow you to store common/recently used files locally, while storing long-term colder data in AWS. Cached volumes offer a substantial cost savings on primary storage and minimize the need to scale your storage on-premises.


You create the VPC with a subnet bearing the CIDR address range of 10.0.1.0/24. Which of the following steps should you take to make this subnet public?

- Create a route in the route table associated with the subnet allowing a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
- Attach an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC.

The correct answers is to attach an Internet Gateway (IGW) and to create a route in the route table out to the Internet Gateway (IGW).


AWS intends to shut down your spot instance; which of these scenarios is possible?

Choose 3

- AWS sends a notification of termination and you receive it 120 seconds before the intended forced shutdown.
- AWS sends a notification of termination, but you do not receive it within the 120 seconds and the instance is shutdown.
- AWS sends a notification of termination and you receive it 120 seconds before the forced shutdown, but the defined duration period (also known as Spot blocks) hasn't ended yet.


When Amazon EC2 is going to interrupt your Spot Instance, it emits an event two minutes prior to the actual interruption (except for hibernation, which gets the interruption notice, but not two minutes in advance because hibernation begins immediately).

It is possible that your Spot Instance is terminated before the warning can be made available.

In rare situations, Spot blocks may be interrupted due to Amazon EC2 capacity needs. In these cases, AWS provides a two-minute warning before the instance is terminated, and customers are not charged for the terminated instances even if they have used them.


DynamoDB has many use cases. Which of the following are legitimate use cases for DynamoDB?
- Storing JSON
- Storing the metadata of BLOB data stored in S3
- Storing web session data

Use cases include storing JSON data, BLOB data and storing web session data. You cannot run relational joins on DynamoDB and storing archived data would be better placed on Glacier


You are building a NAT Instance in an m3.medium using the AWS Linux2 distro with amazon-linux-extras installed. Which of the following do you need to set?
- Ensure that "Source/Destination Checks" is disabled on the NAT instance.

With a NAT instance, the most common oversight is forgetting to disable Source/Destination Checks. TNote: This is a legacy topic and while it may appear on the AWS exam it will only do so infrequently.


REVIEW:
You are reviewing Change Control requests and you note that there is a proposed change designed to reduce errors due to SQS Eventual Consistency by updating the "DelaySeconds" attribute. What does this mean?

Delay queues are similar to visibility timeouts because both features make messages unavailable to consumers for a specific period of time. 
The difference between the two is that, for delay queues, a message is hidden when it is first added to queue, 
whereas for visibility timeouts a message is hidden only after it is consumed from the queue.

Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages. If you create a delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. To set delay seconds on individual messages, rather than on an entire queue, use message timers to allow Amazon SQS to use the message timer's DelaySeconds value instead of the delay queue's DelaySeconds value.
